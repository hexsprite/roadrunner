Changelog
---------

0.2.3.1 (Jun 25, 2009)
======================

- Added a MANIFEST so this can be built by pythons without git support installed.

0.2.3 (Jun 16, 2009)
====================

- Bug #4: OSX Core errors due to no exec after fork.

- Bug #2: the roadrunner script was not being updated properly.  now when you
  re-run buildout it will pickup new dependencies.

0.2.2 (Jun 1, 2008)
===================

Bugs Fixed:

- zope2/lib/python was being placed at the very start of the path which didn't
  allow newer eggs to be seen. Now placed at the end of sys.path.

New Features:

- hack to reset terminal after you kill PDB. May need work for Windows.

0.2.1 (May 26, 2008)
====================

- fixed bug in the buildout recipe that excluded Zope from the sys.path. Bug
  crept in because of "dirty" python install. virtualenv --no-site-packages is
  your friend.

- removed an annoying child process message.

0.2 (May 25, 2008)
==================

-  added a zc.buildout recipe to setup roadrunner with Plone

-  fixed globbing for packages under test

-  fixed child signal handling so you can reliably interrupt running tests
   without killing the parent 

0.1  (May 18, 2008)
